      a little device to help us!

      dice!'
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1262794817540
    m_Localized: Each of these dices will have a different result from one another.
      But pay attention, the more dices you entangle, the more it will cost of your
      Quantum Energy.

    m_Localized: Who said that dice had to be friends... opposition is key! Try now
      the opposite dice.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: 'Congratulations, you now know 3 types of entanglement! (There are
      many other examples of entanglement, but those 3 should be enough for now.) '
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1262794817544
    m_Localized: It is becoming more and more interesting... try to mix the different
      types of entanglement!
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1262794817545
    m_Localized: Hmm hmm... I think you should first from a triplet of gregarious
      dice, then form 3 pairs of opposite dice.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1262794817546
    m_Localized: Good, you are now a master of entanglement, but let that aside for
      the moment...
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1262794817547
    m_Localized: I still have somethin new for you. It would be a shame to play only
      with classical dice.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1262794817548
    m_Localized: Go directly to the Throw Phase and click and the slit.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1262794817549
    m_Localized: Using contructing slits, you are sure to obtain an even result (2,4
      or 6)! But that will consome 1 Quantum Energy each time a die goes through
      the slits.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

      Try it out! '

    m_Localized: 'Bonus info: when a wave goes through slits, it goes throug both
      apertures at once. Both resulting waves interfere, which cancels some possible
      outcomes. Our die is quantum and behaves here like a wave!'

    m_Localized: 'Bonus info: Selfish dice have the same behaviour as fermions, one
      of the two big families of particles. These particles tends to all occupy different
      states, this is for instance the case of electron, which are responsible for
      electricity!'

    m_Localized: 'Bonus info: Opposite dice correspond to a particular entangled
      state also kown as Bell state. I used this state to show that quantum mechanics
      allows you to win more often than clasical mechanics! And thanks to that I
      won the Nobel Prize!'

    m_Localized: 'Bonus info: Gregarious dice have the same behaviour as bosons,
      the other family of particles. These ones tend to al occupy the same state,
      juste like particle of lights. This phenomenon is at the core of Lasers!'

      is priceless!

    m_Localized: Spin defines the different possible states of a quantum object (any
      sufficiently small object, like electrons or atoms). We can see it as a little
      magnet, pointing in a given direction, or several at once (this is a weirdness
      of quantum mechanics)! Here, we have 6 states with our dice.
