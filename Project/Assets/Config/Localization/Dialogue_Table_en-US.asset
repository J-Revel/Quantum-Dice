    m_Localized: Spin defines the different possible states of a quantum object (any
      sufficiently small object, like electrons or atoms). We can see it as a little
      magnet, pointing in a given direction, or several at once (this is a weirdness
      of quantum mechanics)! Here, we have 6 states with our dice.

    m_Localized: It is possible to use this power on different groups of dice.Try

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 1262794817577
    m_Localized: Physical particles have a psin which is like a small compass that
      can point in different directions. One of the main properties of the spin is
      its length (a bit like the length of a compass needle). A particle with integer
      spin (0, 1, 2...) is called "boson", and behaves like the gregarious dice introduced
      in the game.

    m_Localized: First select 2 dice to make them gregarious, valid, then perform
      the exact same action with two other dice.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 52923999436803
    m_Localized: the sum of two opposite dice will always be 7! It is therefore sufficient
      to create 3 pairs of opposing dice.

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 52923999436804
    m_Localized: Oppose a pair of dice and link each die of this pairf to another

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 52923999436806
    m_Localized: The key to have different results is to use selfish dice. It is
      then enough to create two pairs of opposite dice among the selfish ones.

      m_Items: []
